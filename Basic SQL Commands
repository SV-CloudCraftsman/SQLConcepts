1.2 Basic SQL Commands
SQL (Structured Query Language) provides basic commands to interact with databases. These commands fall into the Data Manipulation Language (DML) category, allowing users to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data from tables. Below are the commands with explanations and real-world examples.

1.2.1 SELECT Command
The SELECT command retrieves data from one or more tables. It allows users to specify which columns to display and includes options to filter, sort, and aggregate the data.

Syntax:
sql
Copy code
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Real-World Example:
Imagine a table called Employees:

Employee_ID	Name	Department	Salary
1	Alice	HR	60000
2	Bob	IT	75000
3	Charlie	IT	80000
4	Daisy	Finance	70000
Retrieve all data from the table:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Employees;
Retrieve specific columns:

sql
Copy code
SELECT Name, Department FROM Employees;
Filter rows using a condition:

sql
Copy code
SELECT Name, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'IT';
Result:

Name	Salary
Bob	75000
Charlie	80000
1.2.2 INSERT Command
The INSERT command adds new records to a table.

Syntax:
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
Real-World Example:
Add a new employee to the Employees table.

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Employees (Employee_ID, Name, Department, Salary) 
VALUES (5, 'Eve', 'Marketing', 65000);
Updated Employees table:

Employee_ID	Name	Department	Salary
1	Alice	HR	60000
2	Bob	IT	75000
3	Charlie	IT	80000
4	Daisy	Finance	70000
5	Eve	Marketing	65000
1.2.3 UPDATE Command
The UPDATE command modifies existing records in a table.

Syntax:
sql
Copy code
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;
Real-World Example:
Increase the salary of all employees in the IT department by 10%.

sql
Copy code
UPDATE Employees 
SET Salary = Salary * 1.10 
WHERE Department = 'IT';
Updated Employees table:

Employee_ID	Name	Department	Salary
1	Alice	HR	60000
2	Bob	IT	82500
3	Charlie	IT	88000
4	Daisy	Finance	70000
5	Eve	Marketing	65000
1.2.4 DELETE Command
The DELETE command removes records from a table.

Syntax:
sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Real-World Example:
Remove an employee from the Employees table where the Employee_ID is 5.

sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Employee_ID = 5;
Updated Employees table:

Employee_ID	Name	Department	Salary
1	Alice	HR	60000
2	Bob	IT	82500
3	Charlie	IT	88000
4	Daisy	Finance	70000
Summary of Commands
Command	Purpose	Example
SELECT	Retrieve data from one or more tables	SELECT * FROM Employees;
INSERT	Add new records to a table	INSERT INTO Employees VALUES (5, 'Eve', ...);
UPDATE	Modify existing records	UPDATE Employees SET Salary = ... WHERE ...;
DELETE	Remove records from a table	DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Employee_ID = 5;
Key Notes:
WHERE Clause: Always use the WHERE clause in UPDATE and DELETE commands to avoid unintended changes to all rows.
Best Practices:
Backup your data before performing mass updates or deletions.
Use SELECT first to preview data before modifying or deleting.
