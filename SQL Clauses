1.3 SQL Clauses
SQL clauses modify the behavior of queries and allow more specific operations like filtering, sorting, and limiting the results. Below are explanations and real-world examples for each clause.

1.3.1 WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records based on specific conditions. It retrieves only the rows that satisfy the given condition(s).

Syntax:
sql
Copy code
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Real-World Example:
Consider an Employees table:

Employee_ID	Name	Department	Salary
1	Alice	HR	60000
2	Bob	IT	75000
3	Charlie	IT	80000
4	Daisy	Finance	70000
5	Eve	Marketing	65000
Example 1: Retrieve employees from the IT department.

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'IT';
Result:

Employee_ID	Name	Department	Salary
2	Bob	IT	75000
3	Charlie	IT	80000
Example 2: Retrieve employees with a salary greater than 70000.

sql
Copy code
SELECT Name, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 70000;
Result:

Name	Salary
Bob	75000
Charlie	80000
1.3.2 ORDER BY Clause
The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the query results in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order based on one or more columns.

Syntax:
sql
Copy code
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC];
Real-World Example:
Example 1: Retrieve all employees sorted by salary in ascending order.

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY Salary ASC;
Result:

Employee_ID	Name	Department	Salary
1	Alice	HR	60000
5	Eve	Marketing	65000
2	Bob	IT	75000
4	Daisy	Finance	70000
3	Charlie	IT	80000
Example 2: Retrieve all employees sorted by department (A-Z) and then salary (highest first).

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY Department ASC, Salary DESC;
Result:

Employee_ID	Name	Department	Salary
1	Alice	HR	60000
3	Charlie	IT	80000
2	Bob	IT	75000
4	Daisy	Finance	70000
5	Eve	Marketing	65000
1.3.3 LIMIT Clause
The LIMIT clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query. This is particularly useful for fetching a subset of data, like the top 5 records.

Syntax:
sql
Copy code
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name LIMIT number_of_rows;
Real-World Example:
Example 1: Retrieve the top 3 employees by salary.

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 3;
Result:

Employee_ID	Name	Department	Salary
3	Charlie	IT	80000
2	Bob	IT	75000
4	Daisy	Finance	70000
Example 2: Retrieve the first 2 employees (in the natural order of the table).

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Employees LIMIT 2;
Result:

Employee_ID	Name	Department	Salary
1	Alice	HR	60000
2	Bob	IT	75000
Combining Clauses
Clauses can often be combined in a single query to achieve complex results.

Example: Retrieve the top 2 highest-paid employees from the IT department.
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE Department = 'IT' 
ORDER BY Salary DESC 
LIMIT 2;
Result:

Employee_ID	Name	Department	Salary
3	Charlie	IT	80000
2	Bob	IT	75000
Key Notes:
WHERE:

Filters the rows based on specific conditions.
Supports operators like =, >, <, >=, <=, !=, and logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT.
ORDER BY:

Sorts results in ascending (default) or descending order.
Can sort on multiple columns.
LIMIT:

Restricts the number of rows returned.
Especially useful for pagination in web applications.
